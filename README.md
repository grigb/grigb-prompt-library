## Usage

Prompts in this directory are referenced by:
- AGENTS.md (main configuration file)
- Mode definitions in `~/.agents/modes/`
- Agent orchestration scripts
- Work order execution workflows

## Adding New Prompts

1. Choose the appropriate subdirectory based on purpose
2. Follow naming convention: `ACTION-OBJECT.md` or `MODE-NAME.md`
3. Update this README if adding a new category
4. Update AGENTS.md if the prompt is referenced there
