## Usage Examples

### Direct Reference
```markdown
I need agent-orchestrator to design a multi-agent workflow for this project.
```

### CLI/Script Usage
```bash
# Find all development agents
ls ~/.agents/prompts/agents/agent-dev-*.md

# Search for agents by keyword
grep -l "research\|investigation" ~/.agents/prompts/agents/agent-*.md

```python
# Example: Load agent metadata
import os
import yaml

def get_agent_metadata(agent_name):
    path = f"~/.agents/prompts/agents/{agent_name}.md"
    with open(os.path.expanduser(path)) as f:
        # Parse YAML front matter if present
        content = f.read()
        if content.startswith('---'):
            yaml_end = content.find('---', 3)
            metadata = yaml.safe_load(content[3:yaml_end])
